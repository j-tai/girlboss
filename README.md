# Girlboss

Girlboss is a simple async job manager with progress tracking.

Girlboss allows you to start background tasks and monitor their progress. You can choose to keep track of the jobs yourself, or use the provided manager to look up jobs by whatever ID you want.

For example, this can be useful in web servers where a user starts a job and periodically checks its status.

## Runtime agnostic

Girlboss is compatible with both `tokio` and `actix-rt` runtimes. You must select the runtime you want by enabling the corresponding feature in your `Cargo.toml` file, as shown below.

```toml
[dependencies]
girlboss = { version = "...", features = ["tokio"] }
```

Then, import the `Girlboss`, `Job`, and `Monitor` types from `girlboss::<runtime>` (for example, `girlboss::tokio` or `girlboss::actix_rt`).

The examples below all use `tokio` for consistency. However, all examples should work on all runtimes.

## Jobs and status reporting

You can start background jobs that periodically report their progress, and then you can check on the progress from another task/thread.

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use girlboss::tokio::{Job, Monitor};
use tokio::time::sleep;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Start a job.
    let job = Job::start(long_running_task);

    // Check the status of the job.
    sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
    assert_eq!(job.status().message(), "Computing the meaning of life...");

    // Wait for the job to complete.
    job.wait().await.expect("job failed");
    assert_eq!(job.status().message(), "The meaning of life is 42");

    // See how long the job took.
    assert!(job.elapsed() >= Duration::from_millis(200));
}

/// A long running task that we want to run in the background.
async fn long_running_task(mon: Monitor) {
    write!(mon, "Computing the meaning of life...");

    sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    let meaning = 42;

    write!(mon, "The meaning of life is {meaning}");
}
```

## Job manager

A `Girlboss` instance manages a set of jobs, allowing you to look them up by ID. It also keeps jobs around after they are finished, until they are either overwritten or cleared.

You can choose any type that implements `Ord` to be your job ID type. Here, we choose `String`.

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use girlboss::tokio::{Girlboss, Monitor};
use tokio::time::sleep;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a manager with strings as job IDs.
    let mut manager: Girlboss<String> = Girlboss::new();

    // Start a job.
    let job = manager.start("myJobId", long_running_task).unwrap();

    // Wait for the job to complete.
    let job_2 = manager.get("myJobId").expect("job not found");
    job_2.wait().await.expect("job failed");

    // Check the job status after it's finished.
    let job_3 = manager.get("myJobId").expect("job not found");
    assert_eq!(job_3.status().message(), "The meaning of life is 42");

    // When we look up the job again, we get the same job back.
    assert_eq!(job, job_2);
    assert_eq!(job, job_3);
}

async fn long_running_task(mon: Monitor) {
    write!(mon, "Computing the meaning of life...");

    sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    let meaning = 42;

    write!(mon, "The meaning of life is {meaning}");
}
```

## Error handling

Jobs can optionally return an error, which is then reported through the status.

```rust
use girlboss::tokio::{Job, Monitor};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let job = Job::start(long_running_task);

    // Wait for the job to finish, which returns an `Err` because it failed.
    job.wait().await.unwrap_err();

    // The status message provides more details about the error.
    assert_eq!(job.status().message(), "The meaning of life could not be found");
    assert_eq!(job.succeeded(), false);
}

async fn long_running_task(mon: Monitor) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    write!(mon, "Computing the meaning of life...");
    // The error type can be anything that implements Display, which includes
    // all std::error::Error implementors.
    Err("The meaning of life could not be found")
}
```
